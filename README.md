# CarnivalGameArduino

A simple carnival game for Arduino.

A quick explanation of how it works - https://youtu.be/K-SZLZMKGBw

The aim of the game is to match the red and blue lights. Upon startup, the blue lights will light up and one will be selected at random. The red lights will then light up one by one. The player clicks a button when the red light is in the same place as the blue light. If they fail, the game keeps going. If they succeed, the blue light will reset, and the game will begin again.

While most components were electronic, we also 3D-printed pads for the buttons, in order to make the player experience more comfortable.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Add music for victory
- Make the blue light rotate in the opposite direction, rather than choosing just one light, to increase difficulty
- Use fabricated materials to make the exterior of the device more palatable, and the improve the player experience
